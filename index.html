                    <h4>Referral Program Terms & Conditions</h4>
                    <h6>How to Refer Your Friends</h6>
                    <p>You can now introduce your friends to Fiverr, get them a special discount for their first purchase and earn shopping credit while you're at it! By clicking on the “Refer a Friend” button you can refer friends to Fiverr through your email contacts or your contacts on social networks. We call “Referral” any of your friends who joins Fiverr following your introduction of Fiverr to the friend through this referral system. We call “Referrer” to the user who refers friends using the referral system. The referral system allows you to share the referral with your connections via an email message, or post the referral on Twitter, Facebook, Google plus LinkedIn and personal blogs. You agree to use the referral system only with personal friends and not publish a referral, or cause it to be published or distributed, on or via methods, platforms and media where you have no reasonable basis for believing that all or most of the readers or recipients are your personal friends (such as coupon websites, Reddit, Wikipedia).</p>

<p>Each contact you add to the referral system will receive an email notifying them that you referred us to them, inviting them to visit Fiverr.com. You are required to obtain consents from your Referrals prior to referring them.</p>
               <h6>Eligible Users - Limited Time Only</h6>
               <p>This referral program is open to registered Fiverr users only, for a limited time, and we may withdraw or suspend this referral program (in whole or in part) at any time. The requirements and incentives are also subject to change at any time.</p>
               
               <h6>Earning, Receiving and Redeeming Shopping Credits</h6>
               <p>First, any one of your Referrals will get a 20% discount for their first purchase on Fiverr (capped at US$100). 
In addition, for each Qualifying Purchase made by your Referrals, you, as the Referrer, will receive to your shopping balance US$5 or 20% of the Qualifying Purchase amount, whichever is higher (capped at US$100 credit per Qualifying Purchase). In total, you can earn up to US$500 in shopping credit. Your earnings will be available for use over a three months period.</p>
               
               <h6>Qualifying Purchase</h6>
               <p>A Qualifying Purchase means a successfully delivered and completed Gig(s) purchased by the Referral. A Qualifying Purchase must be made with an external payment method (i.e. not with the Referral's shopping balance).</p>
               
               <h6>Referrals Referred by Multiple Users</h6>
               <p>If your Referral was also referred by another user, you will earn shopping credits only if the Referral registers based on your referral link. If your Referral uses another user's referral link from which they signed up, you will not receive the shopping balance credit.</p>
               
               <h6>If You've Been Invited to Fiverr Via a Referral</h6>
               <p>If you complete a Qualifying Purchase your Referrer will receive the shopping credit to his/her Fiverr account and we will notify your Referrer that he/she earned this credit due to your purchases. However, we will not share with the Referrer details about your purchases.</p>
               
               <h6>Important Disclaimers</h6>
               <p>We reserve the right to suspend your account and remove referrals shopping credit entitlement should we notice any activity we determine contrary to the Referral Program terms and conditions or the Fiverr Terms of Service by the Referrer and/or Referral. We retain the right to investigate the participation in the Referral Program for any fraudulent activities and take any measures to end them. We reserve the right to amend or suspend this Referral Program at any time without notice.</p>
